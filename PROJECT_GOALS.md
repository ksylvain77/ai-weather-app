# Weather app - Project Goals & Requirements

**Framework**: Flask (simple and lightweight)
**Weather API**: Free tier API (OpenWeatherMap or similar)
**Database**: None needed (just live API calls)
**Authentication**: Not required (personal use)
**Deployment**: Local development, maybe simple hosting later## Timeline & Priorities

**Project Timeline**: Casual home project - no rush
**MVP Features**: Basic weather display that works
**Nice-to-Have**: Polish and extra features when time allows

### Constraints & Considerations

**Budget**: Free APIs only
**Team Size**: Solo project (Kevin)
**Technical Constraints**: Simple setup, minimal dependenciesession Results

### Project Overview

**Description**: A personal weather app with automatic location-based current weather and multi-day detailed forecasts
**Type**: Flask application
**Target Users**: Personal use (Kevin)

### Functional Requirements

_[AI fills this during discovery based on user responses]_

#### Core Features

1. **Auto-Location Weather**: Automatic current weather lookup based on user's location
2. **Multi-Day Forecasts**: Detailed weather information for multiple days ahead
3. **Personal Dashboard**: Simple, clean interface optimized for individual use
4. **Today-Focused Layout**: Main display shows current/today's weather prominently
5. **7-Day Forecast**: Weekly forecast displayed below the main today section
6. **Comprehensive Weather Data**: All weather details with emphasis on temperature and precipitation

#### User Stories

- As Kevin, I want to see today's weather prominently when I open the app so that I can quickly check current conditions
- As Kevin, I want to see a 7-day forecast below the main display so that I can plan ahead for the week
- As Kevin, I want the app to automatically detect my location so that I don't have to manually enter it each time
- As Kevin, I want to see temperature and precipitation data most prominently so that I can make daily decisions
- As Kevin, I want access to all weather details (wind, humidity, sunrise/sunset) so that I have complete information when needed
